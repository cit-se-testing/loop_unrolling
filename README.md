These are theory files for the proof assistant Isabelle.

We used Isabelle 2024 to proof the theorems stated in "#88 A formal definition of loop unrolling with application to test coverage".

The `Basics.thy` and `Trace_semantics.thy` contain all the theorems in the paper.
The `Definitions.thy` contain all definitions.
`Lemma.thy` contain lemmas needed to proof the theorems.

To verify the proofs you should open the files with the Isabelle editor. If the theorem is red then it could not verify it. The default installation is good enough.
